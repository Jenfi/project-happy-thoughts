# Happy Thoughts

This project focused on practicing useState-hook in React by fetching and posting data to an API. 

### Tools and techniques used: ðŸ’ª

React, useState-hook, fetch, map. CSS, JSX. I made the layout using flebox.

## My process: ðŸ§ 

With this project I started off workng with the styling first, the styling was simple and I tend to make the easy styling first to visually see the project grow in front of me. This is mainly for motivation purpose, especilly if a project may feel a bit overwhelming at first. Once finishing the styling I made sure I got the data needed while using fetch and then mapping through the json. I divided the project into: styling including adding max- and min- letters for the message and the letter calculator, fetching the data and then posting the data. I added the functionality to the like button at the end.
What I would have done if mroe time: Show a loading message or a spinner while the page is loading
